# API for Cognitive AI

Using a flask API to establish comm between the RL chess engine and and LLM model. At this stage chess engine is working fine and little to no modification is required. The listening code of the API will be added to the model_loading code. llm_model.py is a dummy explanation function that just waits 10 seconds to mimic LLM inference for now.
